publication_short: ""
abstract: "The federal government does not currently have a maximum containment
  level of lead. In other words, major cities with lead in their drinking water
  are not federally required to bring down the lead content as long as they have
  an action plan put in place to do so. This action plan may be vague or take
  many months to execute. This report examines the health risks associated with
  lead found in drinking water and how establishing an MCL for lead can decrease
  health risks associated with the chemical. "
