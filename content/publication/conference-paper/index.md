title: Establishing a Maximum Containment Level Policy for Lead in Drinking Water
authors:
  - admin
abstract: "The federal government does not currently have a maximum containment
  level (MCL) of lead. In other words, major cities with lead in their drinking
  water are not federally required to bring down the lead content as long as
  they have an action plan put in place to do so. This action plan may be vague
  or take many months to execute. This report examines the health risks
  associated with lead found in US drinking water and how establishing an MCL
  for lead can decrease health risks associated with the chemical. "
