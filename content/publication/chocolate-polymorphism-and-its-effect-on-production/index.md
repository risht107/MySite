abstract: "There are six different forms of chocolate, all with their own
  crystalline structure. Form 5 is the commercially available chocolate sold on
  store shelves as it only melts in the hands and not in the mouth. This paper
  discusses why form 5 behaves this way and no others do. Chocolate production
  is a very complicated and strenuous process, and ways to optimize production
  by knowing how form 5 is made is also discussed in this paper.  "
